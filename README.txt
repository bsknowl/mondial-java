We created a Java program using JAXB to parse the XML file and populate classes we created to hold that data. We then
wrote functions for each of the tables we had to insert and went through our data structures pulling out the necessary
data.

Build Instructions:
Requirements: Needs the java compiler and runtime
Running: When our program is run it reads the mondialXML.xml file from the working directory and writes to output.sql
