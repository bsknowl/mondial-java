============

The code is almost done. just a few methods left. I got stuck on the located one. You either enter the located_at together if they're different, but if the same, have to do separate entries...
maybe you can take a crack at it. Sorry if this seems very confusing, I'm a little tired. I won't be able to work on it over the weekend much since I have other homework due Monday and I'm behind on that. Maybe you can finish up the last ones??? If you want, go ahead and redo the located_at. It is a pain right now.
